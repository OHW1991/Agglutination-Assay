Phase Separation-based Antiviral Decoy Particles as Basis for Programmable Broad-spectrum Therapeutics

Supplamentray code prerequisits and instructions

The scripts and instructions provided were tested on Matlab 2023a 64-bit with all available additions.

All scripts were built and tested in a Microsoft Windows 11 Home version 10.0.22631 environment.

Installation instructions: Unzip the file and open the scripts in Matlab
Expected running time of all the scripts: 15 minutes on an average desktop computer

Microscopy image files:
All microscopy files analyzed using the provided scripts were captured on a LSM-700 (Carl Zeiss) confocal microscope, equipped with a BIG (GaAsP detector) unit, using a Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil objective. Images were captured using Zen imaging software (version 8.0, 2012) with a FRET module. A pinhole of 1.5Âµm was set for each laser.
